## Cavenator

The goal of this project is to create a cave generating application on Java for roguelike/2d dungeons. The project will implement [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) to generate random cave formation from user controlled seed.

### Datastructures and algorithms

The project shouldn't require many advanced datastructures as caves can be easily represented and handled in two-dimensional arrays. The focus should be to implement an algorithm to generate random map data based on specifications provided by user and grooming it over steps to make a cohesive end result.

### Further specifications

TBD
