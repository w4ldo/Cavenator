### Generating caves

* Adjust fill percent. This affects how much of the original randomly generated pixels are walls. 25-45% yield optimal results for shaping caves.
* Hit generate random or add a custom seed and generate from it. Custom seed lets you generate identical results multiple times.
* Adjust range for shaping. Determine how far neighbours are checked for shaping walls. Higher range increases time cost. With higher range a lower fill percent yields better results.
* Shape with options A,B,C,D. Different shape methods iterate over map in different order and yield different results.
